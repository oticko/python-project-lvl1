```

## Desription ##

The rules are really simple for all games - answer three questions correctly to complete the game.

There are five games to choose from:
* brain-even
* brain-calc
* brain-gcd
* brain-progression
* brain-prime

### Brain-even ###

```bash
brain-even
```
In this game, you get a random number and you have to answer if the number is even or not.

### Brain-calc ###

```bash
brain-calc
```
In this game, you get a problem consisting of a random mathematical operation with two random numbers. You need to solve this problem and give the correct answer.

### Brain-gcd ###

```bash
brain-gcd
```
In this game you get two random numbers and you need to find thear greatest common factor.

### Brain-progression ###

```bash
brain-progression
```
In this game, you get an arithmetic progression in which one number is accidentally missing. You need to find the missing number.
